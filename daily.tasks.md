1. Task Creation and Assignment

    Task Source: A new task is generated within the GoHighLevel (GHL) platform.

    Individual Assignment: Each task is automatically assigned to a specific team member. This ensures clarity and accountability for every task.

        This assignment can be based on criteria like round-robin, specific user tags, or a manager manually assigning it.

2. Frontend Dashboard Integration

    Task Synchronization: The newly assigned task is pushed from GHL to the Frontend Dashboard.

    Dashboard View: The assigned task becomes visible on the designated user's dashboard. This provides a centralized and personalized view of all their current responsibilities.

    Task 1: (Actionable Step) The task is now ready to be worked on by the assigned team member.

Summary of Improvements

    Clarity: We've replaced "my each person" and "own person takes" with the clearer concept of individual assignment.

    Actionable Steps: The new workflow is broken down into specific, chronological steps with clear labels like Task Creation and Frontend Dashboard Integration.

    Logical Flow: The process is now a clean, two-step flow from the initial source (GHL) to the final destination (the user's dashboard).
